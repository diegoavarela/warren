# IMPORTANT: How to Access Warren on Your Server

## ❌ WRONG URL (This won't work):
- http://localhost:3000/cashflow
- http://localhost:3001/api/...

## ✅ CORRECT URL (Use this):
- http://35.91.208.201:3000/cashflow

## Why?
- `localhost` means YOUR computer
- `35.91.208.201` is your AWS Lightsail server
- All the fixes are deployed on the SERVER, not on your local machine

## To test the Excel AI Wizard:
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: http://35.91.208.201:3000/cashflow
3. Upload your non-standard Excel file
4. The AI wizard should appear
5. Click "Analyze with AI"

## Current Status:
- ✅ Server is running
- ✅ Backend is healthy
- ✅ OpenAI API key is configured
- ✅ Database is ready
- ✅ All fixes are deployed

The server is ready and waiting at: http://35.91.208.201:3000/cashflow
