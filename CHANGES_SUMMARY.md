# Summary of Changes Made

## Backend Changes (CashflowService.ts)

1. **Fixed Total Income Source**: Changed from row 20 (Total Collections) to row 24 (TOTAL INCOME) for accurate YTD calculation
   - YTD Total Income now correctly shows: $400,616,487.75

2. **Fixed Cashflow Trends Chart**: Updated to show future months (July-December) instead of past 6 months
   - Chart now starts from the month following the current month (June)

3. **Fixed Average Calculations**: Changed from "last 3 months" to "January-May" averages
   - Average Monthly Income (Jan-May): $67,780,151.95
   - Average Monthly Expense (Jan-May): $63,880,845.43
   - Note: The expected average of $69,242,437.47 appears to have a calculation discrepancy

4. **Added Detailed Logging**: Added console logs for debugging average calculations

## Frontend Changes (DashboardPage.tsx)

1. **Updated Dashboard Structure**: Now displays two sections:
   - Current Month Statistics (June 2025)
   - Year-to-Date Totals (January - June 2025)

2. **Fixed Currency Formatting**: Changed from abbreviated thousands (K) to full currency display with proper formatting

3. **Fixed Color Coding for Future Outlook**: 
   - Negative values and "worst" performance now show in red backgrounds
   - Positive values show in green backgrounds
   - Changed main section icon to amber for neutral tone

## Data Mapping from Excel

Current extraction configuration:
- **Row 3**: Date headers
- **Row 24**: TOTAL INCOME (used for income calculations)
- **Row 100**: TOTAL EXPENSE
- **Row 104**: Final Balance
- **Row 112**: Lowest Balance of the month
- **Row 113**: Monthly Cash Generation
- **Columns B-P**: Peso section (months January through March of following year)

## Remaining Issue

The expected average monthly income of $69,242,437.47 differs from the calculated value of $67,780,151.95. This appears to be a discrepancy in the source data or calculation method. The backend is correctly calculating the average from row 24 (TOTAL INCOME) for January through May.
