# Upload Flow Test Results

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. Template Selection Flow
- Removed duplicate buttons from TemplateSelector component
- Templates are now clickable cards that can be selected/deselected
- Added "Optional" label to make it clear templates are not required
- Removed auto-selection of default template

### 2. Single Continue Button
- One button that changes text based on selection:
  - "Mapear manualmente" when no template selected
  - "Usar plantilla y continuar" when template is selected
- Button includes DocumentTextIcon for visual consistency

### 3. Clear User Flow
1. Select Company (if not pre-selected)
2. Optionally select a template (click to select, click again to deselect)
3. Select units expression (Normal/Thousands/Millions)
4. Click continue button to proceed to upload

### 4. Visual Improvements
- "Optional" badge on template section
- Green checkmark shows when template is selected
- Helpful text explaining click to deselect
- Clear separation between sections

## User Experience:
- No confusing double buttons
- Clear indication of what will happen (manual mapping vs template)
- Easy to change selection by clicking templates
- Units selection always visible when company is selected
