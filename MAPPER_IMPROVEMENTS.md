# Account Row Mapper Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Column Highlighting (Column A Green Background)
- **Issue**: Account name column (Column A) was showing green background for all rows, making costs look like revenue
- **Fix**: Removed the confusing `bg-green-50` background from account name column
- **Result**: Only mapped accounts show colored backgrounds (left border) based on their actual category

### 2. Fixed Year Selection Behavior
- **Issue**: Year selector was appearing repeatedly and acting weird
- **Fix**: 
  - Added check to only show year selector when truly needed (no year detected AND no context year set)
  - Added close button (X) to dismiss the selector
  - Improved visual feedback showing which year is selected
  - Shows the periods being mapped (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.) in the selector
- **Result**: Year selector only appears once when needed and can be dismissed

### 3. Added Group Tracking for Accounts
- **Issue**: User wanted to know which group accounts belong to (Revenue, Cost of Sales, Operating Expenses, etc.)
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `group` field to CategoryOption interface
  - Defined category groups: Revenue, Cost of Sales, Operating Expenses, Other Income/Expenses, Taxes, Calculated Totals
  - Updated all default categories with appropriate groups
  - Modified account mapping to track group information
  - Enhanced review summary to show accounts grouped by their category groups
- **Result**: Accounts are now organized by groups in the review summary, making it clear which accounts belong to which section of the financial statement

## Visual Improvements

### Row Styling
- Mapped accounts now show with:
  - Colored left border (green for inflow, red for outflow)
  - Subtle background tint (50% opacity)
  - Category badge next to the row number

### Column Styling
- Removed confusing green background from account name column
- Only period columns show purple background
- Account code column shows with monospace font

### Review Summary
- Accounts are now grouped by category (Revenue, Cost of Sales, etc.)
- Each group shows as a section with its accounts listed underneath
- Clear visual hierarchy makes it easy to see the financial statement structure
