## IMPORTANT NOTES:

### About Units üìè
- If your Excel has values in THOUSANDS (like 150 meaning 150,000), the system multiplies by 1,000
- If your Excel has values in MILLIONS (like 1.5 meaning 1,500,000), the system multiplies by 1,000,000
- This is detected during the upload process

### About Currency üí±
- The system detects the original currency from your Excel file
- It can convert between currencies (USD, MXN, EUR, etc.)
- The conversion happens automatically based on exchange rates

### About Period Selection üìÜ
- When you select a specific month, the system looks for that month's column in your Excel
- Each line item can have different values for different months
- The system reads the value for the selected month

## Common Problems and Solutions:

### Problem: "My revenue is showing as 150 instead of 150,000"
**Solution:** The system didn't detect that your values are in thousands. Check the units setting during upload.

### Problem: "My values are in MXN but showing as USD"
**Solution:** The system didn't detect the correct currency. Check the currency setting.

### Problem: "Some categories are showing as zero"
**Solution:** The line items weren't categorized correctly during the mapping process. They need to be marked as "revenue", "cogs", or "operating_expenses".

### Problem: "The totals don't match my Excel"
**Solution:** Check if some line items were skipped during mapping or if the categories were assigned incorrectly.
