# Fixed Account Mapper - Restored Functionality

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Restored Simple Initialization**
- Removed the complex `getInitialPeriodColumns` function that was causing React issues
- Reverted to simple hardcoded periods for quickMode: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr
- Fixed year to 2025 for the test data

### 2. **Removed Smart Detection**
- Removed the `detectAccountType` function that was overriding colors
- Colors now based purely on the selected category's `isInflow` property
- No more automatic color assignment based on account names

### 3. **Kept Visual Improvements**
- ✅ Category badges still show next to mapped accounts
- ✅ Tooltips show what each account is mapped to
- ✅ Period parsing still works (Jan → enero 2025)
- ✅ Check icon color matches inflow/outflow status

### 4. **What Works Now**
- **Clicking**: Rows are clickable again
- **Total Detection**: Orange rows for totals still work
- **Correct Colors**: 
  - Green = Revenue/Income (based on category)
  - Red = Costs/Expenses (based on category)
  - Orange = Detected totals
- **Category Display**: Shows abbreviated category name in badge

## How It Works

1. **Click on any account row** → Opens category selector
2. **Select a category** → Account gets mapped with correct color
3. **Visual feedback**:
   - Badge shows category name
   - Check icon color matches inflow/outflow
   - Tooltip shows full details on hover

## Key Principles Restored

1. **Categories determine colors**, not account names
2. **Simple is better** - no complex auto-detection
3. **User has control** - they choose the mappings
4. **Visual clarity** - see what's mapped at a glance

The mapper is now stable and functional with the good visual improvements retained.
