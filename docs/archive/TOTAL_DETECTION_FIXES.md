# Total Detection Fixes

## Problem
The total detection algorithm was too aggressive, marking regular detail items like "Other Revenue" and "Personnel Salaries" as totals. Additionally, users couldn't manually override the detection.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **More Conservative Total Detection** (lib/total-detection.ts)
- Changed keyword matching to require exact matches or phrases that start with "total"
- Increased confidence threshold from 0.3 to 0.5
- Made section-specific keywords require exact matches

```typescript
// Before: Any substring match
if (lowerName.includes(keyword.toLowerCase())) 

// After: Exact match or starts with "total"
if (lowerName === lowerKeyword || 
    (lowerKeyword.startsWith('total') && lowerName.startsWith(lowerKeyword)) ||
    (lowerKeyword.includes('total') && lowerName === lowerKeyword))
```

### 2. **Manual Override UI** (components/AccountRowMapper.tsx)
- Added a "T" toggle button next to each row in the mapping step
- Users can click to mark/unmark any row as a total
- Visual feedback:
  - Orange button = marked as total
  - Gray button = normal account
- Prevents mapping of rows marked as totals
- Automatically removes existing mappings when marking as total

### 3. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**
- Orange background for detected totals
- Calculator icon for total rows
- Clear instructions about using the "T" button
- Total count display in the UI

## How to Use

1. **Automatic Detection**: The system will detect obvious totals based on keywords
2. **Manual Override**: Click the "T" button next to any row to toggle its total status
3. **Visual Indicators**:
   - Orange rows = totals (cannot be mapped)
   - Green rows = mapped inflow accounts
   - Red rows = mapped outflow accounts
   - Blue hover = clickable for mapping

## Testing
Visit http://localhost:3001/test-mapper to see the improved total detection in action.

The detection should now correctly identify only explicit totals like:
- "Total Revenue"
- "Total Cost of Goods Sold"
- "Gross Profit"
- "Gross Margin"

And not mark regular items like "Other Revenue" or "Personnel Salaries" as totals.
