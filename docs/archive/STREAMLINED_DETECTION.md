# Streamlined Account Detection & Mapping

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Fixed Period Detection**
- **Before**: Shows generic "Period 1, Period 2, Period 3"
- **Now**: Reads actual headers "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr" from row 4
- **Year Detection**: Automatically extracts "2025" from row 2
- **Result**: Shows proper dates like "enero 2025", "febrero 2025"

### 2. **Smart Account Type Detection**
Automatically detects if accounts are inflow/outflow based on keywords:

**Outflow Keywords** (Red/Expenses):
- cost, costo, gastos → Cost of Sales
- salary, wage, nómina, personnel → Salaries & Wages  
- tax, impuesto → Taxes
- rent, arrend → Rent & Utilities
- depreciation → Depreciation
- expense, gasto → Operating Expenses

**Inflow Keywords** (Green/Revenue):
- revenue, ingreso, venta, sales → Revenue
- service, servicio → Service Revenue
- gain, ganancia → Gains

### 3. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**

#### Mapped Account Display:
```
Before: [✓] Direct Personnel Co...  (just green checkmark)
Now:    [✓ Sueldos y Salarios] Direct Personnel Co...  (red check + category badge)
```

#### Row Tooltips:
- **Unmapped**: "Click to map. Suggestion: Salaries & Wages"
- **Mapped**: "Mapped to: Sueldos y Salarios (Outflow ←)"
- **Totals**: "Detected total - Can map to calculated total category"

### 4. **Color Coding Fix**
- **Costs/Expenses**: Now correctly show in RED
- **Revenue/Income**: Show in GREEN  
- **Totals**: Show in ORANGE
- **Check icon color**: Matches inflow/outflow status

### 5. **Category Badges**
Each mapped account now shows:
- Check icon (✓) in correct color
- Category name badge (abbreviated if too long)
- Full category name on hover

## How It Works Now

1. **Automatic Detection on Load**:
   - Detects header row (contains Jan/Feb/Mar)
   - Finds year from data (2025)
   - Identifies account names column
   - Parses period headers to actual dates

2. **Smart Mapping**:
   - Click on "Direct Personnel Costs"
   - System suggests "Salaries & Wages" (detected from keywords)
   - Shows as red (outflow) automatically
   - Displays badge with category name

3. **Visual Clarity**:
   - Green rows = Revenue/Income accounts
   - Red rows = Cost/Expense accounts
   - Orange rows = Totals (can still be mapped)
   - Purple columns = Period data
